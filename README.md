# BATMOBILE
This is a Repo for BATMOBILE Project for " Industrial Electronics " Subject.

# Features
BATMOBILE is controlled in two ways: 

First, it is controlled using voice as We send voice instruction [ "move" - "back" - "right" - "left - "stop" ] from a smart phone recognized by 
Google speech recognetion system and sent by UART.

Second Method: We designed a PCB to have a Joystick and bluetooth module. we send the sampled values of joystick by the bluetooth module to the car using UART.

# Mechanical Design
We have our own mechanical design for the car and printed it using Laser-cut.

# Programming
Batmobile is controlled using Atmega328p Microcontroller.
