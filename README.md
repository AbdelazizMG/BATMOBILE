# BATMOBILE
- This is a Repo for BATMOBILE Project for " Industrial Electronics " Subject.

# Features
BATMOBILE is controlled in two ways: 

- First, it is controlled using voice as We send voice instruction [ "move" - "back" - "right" - "left - "stop" ] from a smart phone recognized by 
Google speech recognetion system and sent by UART.

- Second Method: We designed a PCB to have a Joystick and bluetooth module. we send the sampled values of joystick by the bluetooth module to the car using UART.
